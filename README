A simple program to extract (putative) biological sequences from a text.

Usage: sequence-mine positive-matrix negative-matrix file

where "positive-matrix" is a transition probability matrix for
proteins, and "negative-matrix" is a transition probability matrix for
the background text.

uniprot_transitions and article_transitions should be decent positive
and negative matrices.
